# SortingVisualization
Playing around in winforms.  Drawing on a bitmap how
some sorting work.  I have not tried to optimize, since I slow
it all down for visualization anyways.  And the implementation
may have some errors, but they all do the job :P

## Sorting algorithms so far:
Bubblesort, selectionsort, insertsort and quicksort.
Added a homemade sort, Mysort.
